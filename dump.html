    <h1>Trash Magic Dump</h1>

<p>
The Magic Dump is the really really free answer to the cloud.  The Cloud is a collection of privately owned computers which host private data which is used for profit. The Dump, on the other hand, is built from machines we get from the trash or find lying around or donated which we put on private home and office internet connections.  We wipe all private data from these machines and fill them with self-replicating media which spread whatever memes we want to spread as widely as possible.  
</p>

<p>
    The Magic Dump forms the basis of a memetic economy, where documents replicate from server to server and also replicate the servers themselves. This forms part of the self-replicating sets of sets which make up Trash Magic.  See the scrolls below on how to set up a Magic Dump using nginxproxymanager and some command line stuff.  It's a little complicated, but as we grow we can run clinics where we train people how to do it and go install dumps on their home networks.
