    <h1>Trash Magic Quests</h1>

<p>
Make a cardboard sign and put a Trash Magic Domain on it and place it in a public space.  Make a Trash Magic web page for that place. Point the page to the place and the sign to the page.  Build a trash magic hypertext layer on top of the physical city.  
</p>
<p>
Read about Psychogeography on wikipedia and then wander the city looking to get into situations which distrupt the normal flows of information, people, products, trash, food, objects, information and water.  Create a local psychogeography society, make media advertising it, put that media up in public spaces, find other people to join the society, and conspire with them to spread certain kinds of chaos in the city.  
</p>

<p>
    Replicate the Geometron Hypercube.
</p>

<p>
    Put dirt in the hypercube and use it to replicate plants and fungi, spread the living Internet of Dirt.
</p>

<p>
  Make a cardboard sign 3x6 inches in size and place it in a cube.  Create a trash magic web page on cardboard and pass it to a Trash Magician who will create a virtual image of the page.  
</p>

<p>
    Place a cube in a secret place where rain will not get on it. Create a virtual image for the cube.  Link from a more obvious sign to that virtual image, to create a trail from the public physical link to the public web page to the hidden cube.  Make the hidden be widely shared, but not on the Commercial Internet. Never post anything to Reddit. Ever.
</p>

<p>
   Get 3 Skeletron sticks and construct a tripod.  Place Tripod in the river.
</p>

<p>
    Get 9 Skeletron sticks and create an octahedron.  Place it in the river.
</p>
<p>
    Place tripod on an octahedron to make a higher tower, in or along the river.  Take it down and move it and put it back up. Link it to the Trash Magic pages, make it into hypertext, the Internet of Sticks.
</p>

<p>
    Create a self-replicating synthesizer made of trash and build a product display for it inside a retail store.  Integrate that into the Trash Magic network.  
</p>


<p>
Create a cardboard Einstein tile and replicate it in a public space, creating a feed of self-replicating aperiodic monotiles from trash.
</p>

<p>
    Organize a network of hackers to convert old chrome books into servers.  Get large numbers from the trash, convert them, distribute them to Trash Magicians.  
</p>

<p>
    Ask around until you find someone with an unused Raspberry Pi, turn it into a trash server.  Make it into a trash magic terminal that runs on solar and push it around in public.  Build cyberdecks. 
</p>

<p>
    Build a robe out of trash.  Lurk under a bridge. Share the Magic.
</p>

<p>
    Get free pants from the trash. Create letters which read "Free pants" and stitch them to the pants, wear them, share them, spread them around, replicate them.  Infinite free pants!
</p>

<p>
    Sit in a public space with a terminal and a sign and make free web pages for anyone who wants them.
