    <h1>Denver[your city here] Psychogeography Society</h1>

<p>
    In 1955, Guy Debord defined psychogeography as "the study of the precise laws and specific effects of the geographical environment, consciously organized or not, on the emotions and behavior of individuals."[4] One of the key tactics for exploring psychogeography is the loosely defined urban walking practice known as the dérive. As a practice and theory, psychogeography has influenced a broad set of cultural actors, including artists, activists and academics.
</p>

<p>
    In a dérive one or more persons during a certain period drop their usual motives for movement and action, their relations, their work and leisure activities, and let themselves be drawn by the attractions of the terrain and the encounters they find there… But the dérive includes both this letting go and its necessary contradiction: the domination of psychogeographical variations by the knowledge and calculation of their possibilities.[16]

<p>This page is essentially an advertisement for a wikipedia page.  we create these pages on an unenclosed  digital commons, amplifying the anarchist actions like wikipedia and the Open Web. This is the true nature of anarchist revolution.  An amplification of what already works outside of property, which can then expand and consume the system of private property.</p>

<p>
    Find the others. Build the society. Fill the city with our memes.  We will build NeoDenver in the ashes of the old burning city.
